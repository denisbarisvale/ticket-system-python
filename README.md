# Ticket System (Python)

This is my first Python project.

## 🚀 My Journey

About one year ago, I started learning Python with excitement, but I quit very early when I was only at the “hello world / simple input” level.

After some time, I decided to start again — this time seriously.

In just 12 days, I went from basic concepts to building this project from scratch:
- Handling user input
- Validating data
- Using functions properly
- Applying basic logic and conditions
- Structuring a small but complete program

This project is a milestone for me.  
It marks the moment I stopped just “trying” and started **building**.

This is only the beginning. More versions and more advanced projects will come.

## 🧩 Features

- Asks for user name, age, and student status
- Validates all inputs
- Calculates ticket price based on rules
- Prints a clean ticket summary
- Uses functions to keep code structured and readable

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python ticket_system_v1.py
